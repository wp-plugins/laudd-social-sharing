== Description ==

Laudd dramatically increase social buzz and traffic. With this plugin you get to:

* Encourage Sharing: The Laudd sharing toolbar automatically appears on all posts, and users are encouraged to share more as they earn points when the posts they share generate traffic back to your website.
* Reward Influencers: Automatically or manually mark portions any of your pages as "premium". Users can use points they earn by generating traffic to your website to view premium content on any participating website.
* Gain Insights: Detailed and accurate metrics of sharing and visits through all supported social networks based on customizable time range.
	
= How It Works =

* After you install and activate the plugin and register a new website, all your posts automatically display the Laudd sharing toolbar. 
* The toolbar is responsive, in that it automatically adjusts its user interface depending on whether the user is visiting your website from a PC, tablet or smartphone.
* Users get 10 points on sign up, and earn two points for every visit they generate through content they have shared using this toolbar. 
* If a user runs out of points, he or she can conveniently review previously read articles and share it from within the page he or she is viewing.
* You can automatically or manually mark premium content in any post. Points earned can be used to view premium content.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why should I use the Laudd Plugin? =
The Laudd Plugin instantly enables you to increase your website visitors, social buzz, and if you have a subscription option, your subscribers. The Laudd plugin encourages your users to share your posts on social media in order to earn privilege points, and view your premium content (or premium content on other sites) with those points. Since points are awarded only when the shared content generates traffic, Laudd only encourages meaningful sharing. The ability to display premium content on any post makes a subscription option look more valuable, thus increasing your subscribers.
= How do I display the Laudd sharing toolbar on my posts? =
When you install and activate the Laudd plugin, you automatically get the Laudd sharing toolbar on all "single" posts of your WordPress website. The Laudd sharing toolbar does not appear on any special "pages", such as the home page of your WordPress website.
= How do my users share my pages using the Laudd sharing toolbar? =
Users simply click on the icon of the social network that they want to share your content on in order to initiate the sharing process. If the user is not already signed up with Laudd, the user is asked to sign up using the social network that he or she clicked on to share the content. The user is encouraged to sign up in order to earn privilege points, which enable the user to view premium content. If the user doesn't want to sign up, the user can simply share the content by clicking the link at the bottom of that dialog. Once the user signs up (or declines to sign up), he or she can enter comments and then share the content on that social network.
= What does Laudd mean by "premium content"? =
Premium Content as defined by Laudd is certain items within your posts (e.g. infographics, parts of the text, videos, images, etc.) that are specifically marked by the editor / author of the post as premium. This content is overlaid with a Laudd UI layer that makes it difficult for an unprivileged user to view the content. Privileged users can consume one privilege point from his or her Laudd account in order to view all premium content on a post. A user may set his or her preference to automatically view all premium content on the page, or may specifically request to see premium content by clicking the "view" button.
= How do I specify certain content to be premium in a post? =
In the WordPress Visual Editor (aka the WYSIWYG editor), you will see a new button "Mark Premium Content" above the formatting tools. This button is also present on the raw text editor. The button is normally disabled, but if you select a portion of the content in your visual editor or text editor, the button is enabled. Clicking the button will allow you to add an optional caption. The caption is displayed to unprivileged users, whereas the content you mark as premium is overlaid with a "Premium Content" overlay and obscured from the view of unprivileged users. Privileged users do not see the caption but can see the premium content as normal content on the page.
= What do my users need to do to view my premium content? =
Users need to sign up to Laudd using one of the supported social networks. A user is awarded 10 privilege points upon signing up. If the user shares content from any website in the Laudd Publisher Network, then the user gets two points for every visit generated by that shared content back to the website it was shared from. If a user has non-zero points in his Laudd account, he or she can click the green "View" button visible on the premium content.
= Which metrics does the Laudd Plugin display to me as a site administrator? =
The Laudd plugin can display to you accurate statistics of the social behavior of all posts of your website that display the Laudd toolbar. It tells you for any given time period, the total number of unique visits and visitors to the posts, the total number of visits and visitors from specific or all supported social networks, and number of pages shared, and total shares on each or all supported social networks. The Laudd Plugin also presents on a page-by-page basis, the total shares on all or specific supported social networks for any specified time period.
= How do I remove premium content from a post? =
You can configure your site to automatically mark the bottom 25% of your post as premium. When you have manually marked premium content in a post, you will see the "short code" [LauddObscure] where the premium content begins, and the short code [/LauddObscure] where the premium content ends. If you have added a caption, you will see it encapsulated in the short code [LauddHide] and [/LauddHide]. Simply remove these short codes to remove the appearance of the premium content from that post.
= Are there any permalink requirements for Laudd premium content to work properly? =
Yes, you need to have a permalink style that has a unique "path" section of the URL for each post. Specifically the older style of URLs, i.e. the one which has a fixed path and a "p=123" appended to it, will not allow Laudd to calculate premium content consumption of users correctly, thereby allowing a user who has consumed premium content on one page to be able to view premium content on all your pages without consuming additional Laudd privilege points.
= Will you support more social networks in the future =
Yes. While the current supported social networks cover the vast majority of the sharing activity on the internet, we are working on supporting a number of other social networks in the near future.
